Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.&r\n\n&6&lBotania's design philosophy&r\n- No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n- No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n- No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n- Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n- Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n&6&lBotania's goals&r\n\n- Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n- Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n- Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n- Create an overall immersive experience.\n\nDifficulty: &6☆☆&r\nCost: &6☆&r\nStrength: &6☆☆☆&r",
